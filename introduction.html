                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The city is surrounded to the south by the Great Lake, a massive ocean with strange unatural laws that all who travel on it must abide by, and on all other sides by The Outskirts, a desolte land out of view from the Watchful eye of The Head where monsters and rag tag groups of humans roam freely. Said City is divided into 26 districts with each one consisting of a Nest and the Backstreets with the nests being ruled by their respective wings and the backstreets being unregulated and unprotected. At the top of the City, you have the Head assisted by the Eye and the Claw, corresponding to district A, B and C respectively.</p>

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0"> Very little is known about the Head but we do know that it enforces its own "ethics" through a list of taboos. The taboos are rules that should they be broken, those who committed the crime will be swiftly and unubiquisly elimited by the agents of the Head. One of the more important taboos is that which doesn't allow for sentient AIs to exist through the AI ethics amedment. Each nest also has its own taboos but breaking them is a "lesser" crime compared to that of a city taboo, though it will still result in your swift and efficient extermination.<br>The City was founded at least 400 hundred years ago by The Head at a time where the technology was already somewhat advanced with the districs and associations already established, some of its taboos can be traced back to that time as when it took root, a race of sentient beings were already established and after they were kicked out, The Head made it a taboo to have a non human sentient life form within the walls of The City.</p>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Each Wing is the owner of 1 or more singularities that is at the core of their revenue and power as these singularies are essentially magic. These singularities are patented and approved by the head making any copy of it against the rules but doing your own research to discover something that works in the same way is allowed though you run the risk of being killed by personal of the Wing whose singularity you are attempting to copy. The Wings however can sell usage of it to other Wings as a partnership such as W corp using T corp technology within its trains or L corp selling its energy to R and T corp while it was still running.</p>

                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Wings can collapse on their own due to internal pressure though this is relatively rare with the more common option being an all out War of the Wings where multiple wings duke it out until one falls. The ruins of which you can then use as foundations upon which to build your company. These wars however are very rare as they are not only risky for the attacking wings but also very bloody conflicts where the loosing side not only looses its control and power but the inhabitants of the district are left to fend for themselves. This being the case, only a few have happened throughout history with the most recent one being The Smoke War in which the old L corp was overthrown by an alliance between the founders of Lobotomy Corporation, R corp and W corp to name a few. </p>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Some of the most important work in the city comes from the associations and syndicates within it. An association does work within nests while the syndicates work in the Backstreets. An association is made up of fixers and offices with fixers being akin to mercenaries and offices being smaller fixer-run buinesses. There are 12 total associations that specialise in different tasks, the Zwei for example specialise in defence and protection. Overseeing all these associations and offices is the Hana association that also takes care of gradding both the fixers and the threats they face based on power/danger with fixer grades randing from 9 to 1 to colour fixer and the threats randing from Urban Myth to Star of the City. There is a rank above that of Star of the City which is Impuritas Civitatis meaning impurity of the state though this title can only be bestowed by the head should they deem that the entity it is given to violates its ethics.</p>

                    <div class="row gx-5 align-items-center">
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Colour Fixers are amoung the most powerful people in the city with the title of colour forcefully being given by the Hana Association only to those who have demonstrated extroadinary power and ability beyond the scope of a grade 1 fixer with only one type of colour existing at a time such as The Red Gaze. The title of colour however can be removed at any time by the Hana association should they deem the bearer no longer worthy of holding that title. The title of colour fixer is the dream of anyone starting out as they are percieved as having absolute freedom about the jobs they want to do and can even pursue their own endeavours outside the realms of fixer work. Syndicates on the other hand are much less regulated and follow the rule of the strongest with the 5 most powerful of them forming the Hand with the respectively being called The Thumb, The Index, The Middle, The Ring and The Pinky. Each syndicate has rules and customs that each member and affiliate must adhere to with varying degrees of punishment should they be transgressed. Syndicates spend most of their time battling others for control over the backstreets with fierce rivalries between some of them, no matter their status, such as between the Blade Lineage and the Kurokumo Clan and between any of the members of the Hand.</p>
