                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The city is divided into 26 different districts. Each district holds a letter and each is seperated between the Wing and the Backstreets. The Wing is essentially just a megacorporation that holds (almost) absolute power of its inhabitants. They hold such power through the ownership and usage of a Singularity, an almost magic like piece of technology. Such example would be T Corp that allows for full manipulation of time within its district. The Backstreets however are a lawless land where the Wing's influence is essentially non-existent and its a fight for survival. Controlling the backstreets are syndicates, groups of powerful individuals that inforce their rulles and ideas upon those they protect. Standing above them all is the Hand, the group of the 5 most powerful ones, called respectively The Thumb, The Index, The Middle, The Ring and The Pinky. The counterpart to these within the Wings are offices and associations that do the same thing but in a more regulated envireonment. At the top of the food chain, you find The Head, a mysterious entity taht rules over and enforces various rules known as "taboos" where breaking a taboo will result in your immediate and grueseome extermination. Extermination you are the Arbiters and the Claws aided by the beholders that come from A, C and B corp respecitvely.</p>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Each Wing is the owner of 1 or more singularities that is at the core of their revenue and power as these singularies are essentially magic. These singularities are patented and approved by the head making any copy of it against the rules. The Wings however can sell usage of it to other Wings as a partnership such as W corp using T corp technology within its trains. To establish a new Wing, you need a piece of technology that is powerful and interesting enough to be used as a singularity and then you need to quick an already established wing out in what is known as a war of the wings. These however are very rare and only a few have happened throughout history with the most recent one being with the old L corp that Lobotomy Corporation took over through various alliances with other corporations.</p>

An association is made up of fixers and offices with fixers being akin to mercenaries and offices being smaller fixer-run buinesses. There are 12 total associations that specialise in different tasks, the Zwei for example specialise in defence and protection. Overseeing all these associations and offices is the Hana association that also takes care of gradding both the fixers and the threats they face based on power/danger with fixer grades randing from 9 to 1 to colour fixer and the threats randing from </p>
