At the top of the City, you have the head assisted by the beholders and the claws, corresponding to district A, B and C respectively. Very little is known about the Head but we know that it only enforces what it considers to be the ethics of the city and the taboos of the city. The taboos are rules that should they be broken, those who committed the crime will be swiftly and unubiquisly elimited by the agents of the Head. One of the more important taboos is that which doesn't allow for sentient AIs to exist through the AI ethics amedment (do check)</p>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Each Wing is the owner of 1 or more singularities that is at the core of their revenue and power as these singularies are essentially magic. These singularities are patented and approved by the head making any copy of it against the rules but doing your own research to discover something that works in the same way is allowed though you run the risk of being killed by personal of the Wing whose singularity you are attempting to copy. The Wings however can sell usage of it to other Wings as a partnership such as W corp using T corp technology within its trains or L corp selling its energy to R and T corp while it was still running. To establish a new Wing, you need a piece of technology that is powerful and interesting enough to be used as a singularity. You then need to find a district in which to build your new empire but wings being very well established entities makes this extremely difficult and dangerous. </p>

                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Wings can collapse on their own due to internal pressure though this is relatively rare with the more common option being an all out War of the Wings where multiple wings duke it out until one falls. The ruins of which you can then use as foundations upon which to build your company. These wars however are very rare as they are not only risky for the attacking wings but also very bloody conflicts where the loosing side not only looses its control and power but the inhabitants of the district are left to fend for themselves. This being the case, only a few have happened throughout history with the most recent one being The Smoke War in which the old L corp was overthrown by an alliance between the founders of Lobotomy Corporation, R corp and W corp to name a few. </p>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Some of the most important work in the city comes from the associations and syndicates within it. An association does work within nests while the syndicates work in the Backstreets. An association is made up of fixers and offices with fixers being akin to mercenaries and offices being smaller fixer-run buinesses. There are 12 total associations that specialise in different tasks, the Zwei for example specialise in defence and protection. Overseeing all these associations and offices is the Hana association that also takes care of gradding both the fixers and the threats they face based on power/danger with fixer grades randing from 9 to 1 to colour fixer and the threats randing from Urban Myth to Star of the City. There is a rank above that of Star of the City which is Impuritas Civitatis but this title can only be given by the head to the things or those whom it deems violates its ethics. </p>

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Colour Fixers are amoung the most powerful people in the city with the title of colour being given only to individuals that have demonstrated extroadinary power and ability with only one type of colour existing at a time, though the title of a colour can be removed if the Hana association deems the owner no longer worthy. Syndicates on the other hand are much less regulated and follow the rule of the strongest with the 5 most powerful of them forming the Hand with the respectively being called The Thumb, The Index, The Middle, The Ring and The Pinky. Each syndicate has rules and customs that each member and affiliate must adhere to with varying degrees of punishment should they be transgressed. Syndicates spend a lot of their time battling others for control over the backstreets with fierce rivalries between some of them, such as between the Blade Lineage and the Kurokumo Clan.</p>
