                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">About the community</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This game and the project moon universe as a whole posseses a dedicated, almost cult like, fanbase that will take any opportunity to talk about it, the existence of this website being a good example of such behavior. In fact, project moon fans can be found so often that we have been given the name of sleeper agents where we will appear in any comment section or thread, should even a line of dialogue appear within said post, to shitpost (see the genshin wild hunt post). <br>Apart from the shitpost however, you will find a lot of poeple that just want to talk about one of their favorite games which can lead to very cool interactions. Moreover, you can find a good amount of youtube videos talking about the lore and gameplay, in fact there is a plethora of videos online that </p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/horns.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure> <!--change this at some point into a hover show and maybe change it into something less cluttered (rip my shin/mang/manifesting one's ego segway)-->
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The gameplay</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before entering a battle, you have a choice of between 5 and 7 sinners with the rest being backup units that can give you support passives. For each sinner, you can choose to equip an Identity which is them from a "mirror world" in which they chose different paths in life that led to do different things. These identities are what make the core of the gameplay variety as they allow you to build around specific status effects of which there is a great number of, granting the player almost complete freedom in how they want to approach the game. <br>There are 2 different battle types, focused and unfocused encounters but while they diverge in gameplay, their core concepts are the same. Notably, the most important part of combat, aka clashes, remain untouched. Clashes happen when 2 characters attack each other at the same time. During a clash, both characters flip their skill coins and the one who rolls lowest looses a coin until all are lost, at which point the opposide side attacks you with their own remaining coins. The odds aren't 50/50 however as there is a sanity mechanic that can increase or decrease your odds of hitting heads which ranges from 45 to -45 with each unit giving a flat 1% increase in odds.<br>The game is divided between 3 main modes: the story, the dungeon and refraction railway. The story battles are somewhat basic yet some are uniquely complexe and require deep reading and understanding of the ennemy to win while the dungeon and railway serve as the endgame in which you can either try and reach the highest floor possible in the case of the dungeon or the lowest turn count possible in the case of refraction railway.
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Big clash.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In unfocused encounters, you simply drag a chain across all skins you want to use at the bottom of the screen and they will automatically target ennemy skills. These tend to be the easier battles but upon reaching a certain level of difficulty, they actually become rather cumbersome as the game choose where you attacks go automatically meaning you need to manipulate it to succeed. This requires a fair bit of game knowledge and is why you only really need to do it while deep in the dungeon</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Dawn of green.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In focused encounters however, it is you the player who chooses specifically where each skill goes. This is where the teambuilding and strategising aspect of the game shines as you need to carefully anticipate not only the ennemy's attacks a few turns in advance but also your own in order to be as efficient as possible. As in you need to manage your status applications, damage dealt, damage recieved and ennemy phase changes in most cases. </p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Focused butler.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Another important aspect of combat is the usage of EGO that are special attacks that come from abnomalities such as Fourth March Flamme originating from Scorched Girl or Tears of the Tarnished blood that is extracted from Yinglong. On a basic level, these serve only as high rolling attacks to win clashes but in the hands of any knowledgable player, they become stepping stones for intricate strategies through their unique status applications and passives. Each EGO posseses it's own "risk level" which reflects it's power, to some degree at least. This risk level can and can't be based on the original obnomality as it depends on the wielder's predisposition.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The story and its litterary counterparts</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As mentioned on the main page, this game is entierelly based on adaptations of famous novels from all around the world but also some modern elements of pop culture such as Half Life though they are more scarce. The story itself is divided into cantos just like in Dante Allegri's Divine Comedy. In each canto, we explore the fathoms of the respective sinner, exploring their past and helping them come to terms with it. In total we can count 13 classic novels: The Metamorphosis, Crime and Punishement, Demian a story of boyhood, The Wings, Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights, Don Quixote, Dream of the red chamber, Hell Screen, The Stranger, The Odyssey, Faust and Inferno with them corresponding to the characters of Gregor, Rodion, Sinclair, Yi Sang, Ishmael, Heathcliff, Don Quixote, Hong Lu, Ryōshū, Mersault, Outis, Faust and Dante.<br> The goal of the company isn't itself to solve our sinner's trauma but rather to collect the Golden Boughs, branches of the Tree of Life that hold limitless possibilities, helping our characters is purely a byproduct of that quest. <br> There are obviously a lot more references but talking about them all would take hours of litterary analysis and cross referencing obscure lines of dialogue which far exceeds the scope of this website but that won't stop me from mentioning a few such as indiscriminate religious references like the Tree of Life from Budhism(?) and the 4 horesmen of the apocalypse but also some folklore, notably germanic in the form of The Wild Hunt and Der Freischütz.<br> What I can say however is that the story and characters are extremelly well written and handled, you really feel their character growth throughout the story and having read most of the source material, I get to really appreciate the tiny details that are scattered throughout, may they be explicit or implicit.<br> Overall, the simple fact that every canto centers around a different character while dealing with themes related to them results in the themes discussed being so varied that there is something for everyone so all can enjoy. This keeps the game fresh any time the story progresses and keeps every new canto feeling fresh and emotionally impactful.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Game performance</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The game itself runs very well both in the story mode and at a base level. This is due to its visually simple battles and lack of any abundance in the combat variables. This however doesn't hold up at all in the dungeon when you know what you are doing as you end up with an almost obnoxious amount of buffs and debuffs that the game has to calculate resulting in what you might consider to be choppy gameplay. This is in part due to E.G.O gifts that are items derived from abnomalities, such as the Dawn of Scarlet moths that comes from Sunset Wayfarer or the Fourth Leaf Clover that comes from Fairy-Long-Legs. As explained previously, a lot of these items give you extra status effects (of which there is already well over 300 that can be applied to the sinners), such as Slash power up, Near-light Superbattery, Microprecision Time Acceleration and Hardblood cast. All of these impact the gameplay to someextent You can however mittigate the lag to some extent by reducing the graphics quality but at least in my experience, it's more so a placebo effect than anything impactful.</p>
