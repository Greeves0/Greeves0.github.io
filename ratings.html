                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The graphics and art style</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This game posseses a few different artstyles depending on what part of the game you are looking at while also being visually distinct from the 2 previous games in the franchise.<br>The story mode posses a very visual novel type of format with very detailed background and characters. This level of detail allows for a lot of environmental storytelling that immerses the player in the Project Moon universe.<br>In combat however, the art style changes to something more simplistic for the characters on the field while obviously giving them animations for their attacks and interactions.</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/horns.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure> <!--change this at some point into a hover show and maybe change it into something less cluttered (rip my shin/mang/manifesting one's ego segway)-->
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The gameplay</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before entering a battle, you have a choice of between 5 and 7 sinners with the rest being backup units that can give you support passives. For each sinner, you can choose to equip an Identity which is them from a "mirror world" in which they chose different paths in life that led to do different things. These identities are what make the core of the gameplay variety as they allow you to build around specific status effects of which there is a great number of, granting the player almost complete freedom in how they want to approach the game. <br>There are 2 different battle types, focused and unfocused encounters but while they diverge in gameplay, their core concepts are the same. Notably, the most important part of combat, aka clashes, remain untouched. Clashes happen when 2 characters attack each other at the same time. During a clash, both characters flip their skill coins and the one who rolls lowest looses a coin until all are lost, at which point the opposide side attacks you with their own remaining coins. The odds aren't 50/50 however as there is a sanity mechanic that can increase or decrease your odds of hitting heads which ranges from 45 to -45 with each unit giving a flat 1% increase in odds.<br>The game is divided between 3 main modes: the story, the dungeon and refraction railway. The story battles are somewhat basic yet some are uniquely complexe and require deep reading and understanding of the ennemy to win while the dungeon and railway serve as the endgame in which you can either try and reach the highest floor possible in the case of the dungeon or the lowest turn count possible in the case of refraction railway.
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Big clash.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In unfocused encounters, you simply drag a chain across all skins you want to use at the bottom of the screen and they will automatically target ennemy skills. These tend to be the easier battles but upon reaching a certain level of difficulty, they actually become rather cumbersome as the game choose where you attacks go automatically meaning you need to manipulate it to succeed. This requires a fair bit of game knowledge and is why you only really need to do it while deep in the dungeon</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Dawn of green.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In focused encounters however, it is you the player who chooses specifically where each skill goes. This is where the teambuilding and strategising aspect of the game shines as you need to carefully anticipate not only the ennemy's attacks a few turns in advance but also your own in order to be as efficient as possible. As in you need to manage your status applications, damage dealt, damage recieved and ennemy phase changes in most cases. </p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Focused butler.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Another important aspect of combat is the usage of EGO that are special attacks that come from abnomalities such as Fourth March Flamme originating from Scorched Girl or Tears of the Tarnished blood that is extracted from Yinglong. On a basic level, these serve only as high rolling attacks to win clashes but in the hands of any knowledgable player, they become stepping stones for intricate strategies through their unique status applications and passives. Each EGO posseses it's own "risk level" which reflects it's power, to some degree at least. This risk level can and can't be based on the original obnomality as it depends on the wielder's predisposition.</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/faust ego.png" alt="V1 being cool" /><p>Image of all 4 EGO slots being used on Faust</p></figure>                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The story and its litterary counterparts</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As mentioned on the main page, this game is entierelly based on adaptations of famous novels from all around the world but also some modern elements of pop culture such as Half Life though they are more scarce. The story itself is divided into cantos just like in Dante Allegri's Divine Comedy. In each canto, we explore the fathoms of the respective sinner, exploring their past and helping them come to terms with it. In total we can count 13 classic novels: The Metamorphosis, Crime and Punishement, Demian a story of boyhood, The Wings, Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights, Don Quixote, Dream of the red chamber, Hell Screen, The Stranger, The Odyssey, Faust and Inferno with them corresponding to the characters of Gregor, Rodion, Sinclair, Yi Sang, Ishmael, Heathcliff, Don Quixote, Hong Lu, Ryōshū, Mersault, Outis, Faust and Dante.<br> The goal of the company isn't itself to solve our sinner's trauma but rather to collect the Golden Boughs, branches of the Tree of Life that hold limitless possibilities, helping our characters is purely a byproduct of that quest. <br> There are obviously a lot more references but talking about them all would take hours of litterary analysis and cross referencing obscure lines of dialogue which far exceeds the scope of this website but that won't stop me from mentioning a few such as indiscriminate religious references like the Tree of Life from Budhism(?) and the 4 horesmen of the apocalypse but also some folklore, notably germanic in the form of The Wild Hunt and Der Freischütz.<br> What I can say however is that the story and characters are extremelly well written and handled, you really feel their character growth throughout the story and having read most of the source material, I get to really appreciate the tiny details that are scattered throughout, may they be explicit or implicit.<br> Overall, the simple fact that every canto centers around a different character while dealing with themes related to them results in the themes discussed being so varied that there is something for everyone so all can enjoy. This keeps the game fresh any time the story progresses and keeps every new canto feeling fresh and emotionally impactful.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Game performance</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe.</p>
