                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The sound track</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Just like the previous games, this one's soundtrack is made of tracks from Studio EIM and Mili. The former being mostly for normal encounters and "minor" boss fights and the latter making the titular song for the canto. Both bands having distinct styles with Studio EIM offering more intense and fast paced music while Mili offers a calmer more profound listening experience.<br>Studio EIM is a South Korean band, that was created in 1999 and has made music for a lot of video games but they aren't limitted to that. Indeed, they also do dubbing and take care of sound design which especially in Limbus Company is Exceptional with each attack having its own distinct effect, thus making it possible to not only identity the ID that is attacking/clashing but also in some cases, you can even identify the specific attack.<br> Mili on the other hand, is a Japanese based band that only takes care of the titular canto's song, as stated previously. This song is only heard during the final boss fight and when the credits roll with its lyrics and tune being perfectly remminiscent of the story that just unfolded before your eyes. Such songs include "Through patches of violet" where we have 2 superimposing voices that represent Heathcliff and Catherine with them being ever so slightly out of sync with each other, representing their inability to communicate with each other, despite how close they were.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Accessibility</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The game is voiced exclusively in Korean with an english and chinese translation being available which you might find to be somewhat limiting, but do keep in mind that this is only a small independant game studio so it's already quite good, especially seeing the quality of the voices acting as you don't need to speak korean to be able to appreciate the effort and emotions put into it. As mentioned in the gameplay section, the game itself is quite accessible at a basic level, however bothced the in-game tutorial may be. To compensate for the lackluster tutorial, you can find a flury of videos online that do a much better job at explaining the in-game mechanics which definetly makes certain aspects of the game a lot easier to approach once you have that extra knowledge in mind. As for the lack of english voice over, if it truly is a dealbreaker for you as you're going to have to read, 2 words: grow up. You're not 5 years old and are more than capable of reading some text on a sceen. I'd even argue that it is useful to learn some vocabulary as the game, just like its predesessors for that matter, can be quite advanced and thus makes for an enriching experience.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How long to get good?</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I've talked at what could be considered great lengths about the combat but the obvious question that emerges from all that is: how long does it take to get good? <br> Well the anser is quite simple, it doesn't. This game at base is very beginner friendly, granted you disregard the in game tutorial and look at a couple videos online that do a much better job at exlaining the mechanics than the game itself for some reason, but overall, you don't need to put that much effort or time into getting a universally viable team. Case and point is that you can very much just throw together the 6 strongest units you can find and that will work as at the end of the day, all you need are those sweet high clash numbers, such team could be KoD Rodian, Thumsault, Lord Hong Lu, MaoFaust, Firefist Gregor and Wild Hunt, such team has very little synergy but they are individually very strong.<br>If however you want to have a team with proper synergy around a certain status effect, such as sinking, some time will need to be invested in order to reach that goal. The time however is quite short, in fact you only need about 3 hours total per week once you know what you are doing, and then a few weeks of that to get new characters and be able to upgrade them to the desired level.<br>To get even more efficient in your team building and strategies, a good use of time would be to scoure the wiki, looking for specific interactions or status applications that might benifit your team but just running it down the mirror dungeon every week is also a good way to learn the ins and outs of the game.<br> Overall, I have well over 1500 hours spent not only playing the game, but looking through wiki pages and writing information down but it is definetly excessive and far from what you need to do as this is just something I particularly enjoy.</p>
