                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The sound track</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Just like the previous games, this one's soundtrack is composed made up of tracks from Studio EiM and Mili. The former being mostly for normal encounters and "minor" boss fights and the latter making the titular song for the canto. Both bands offer a distinct style with Studio EiM offering more intense and fast paced music while Mili offers a chiller more profound listening experience.<br>Studio EiM is a South Korea based group that has existed since 1999 and has made music for a lot of video games but they aren't limitted to that. Indeed, they also do dubbing and take care of sound design which especially in Limbus Company is Exceptional with each attack having its own distinct effect, thus making it possible to not only identity the ID that is attacking/clashing but also in some cases, you can even identify the specific attack.<br> Mili on the other hand, is a Japanese based band that only takes care of the titular canto's song, as stated previously. This song is only heard during the final boss fight and when the credits roll with its lyrics and tune being perfectly remminiscent of the story that just unfolded before your eyes. Such songs include "Through patches of violet" where we have 2 superimposing voices that represent Heathcliff and Catherine with them being ever so slightly out of sync with each other, representing their inability to communicate with each other, despite how close they were.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Accessibility</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The game is voiced exclusively in Korean with an english and chinese translation being available which you might find to be somewhat limiting, but do keep in mind that this is only a small independant game studio so it's already quite good, especially seeing the quality of the voices acting as you don't need to speak korean to be able to appreciate the effort and emotions put into it. As mentioned in the gameplay section, the game itself is quite accessible at a basic level, however bothced the in-game tutorial may be. To compensate for the lackluster tutorial, you can find a flury of videos online that do a much better job at explaining the in-game mechanics which definetly makes certain aspects of the game a lot easier to approach once you have that extra knowledge in mind. As for the lack of english voice over, if it truly is a dealbreaker for you as you're going to have to read, 2 words: grow up. You're not 5 years old and are more than capable of reading some text on a sceen. I'd even argue that it is useful to learn some vocabulary as the game, just like its predesessors for that matter, can be quite advanced and thus makes for an enriching experience.</p>
