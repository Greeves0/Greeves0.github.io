                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The sound track</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Just like the previous games, this one's soundtrack is composed made up of tracks from Studio EiM and Mili. The former being mostly for normal encounters and "minor" boss fights and the latter making the titular song for the canto. Both bands offer a distinct style with Studio EiM offering more intense and fast paced music while Mili offers a chiller more profound listening experience.<br>Studio EiM is a South Korea based group that has existed since 1999 and has made music for a lot of video games but they aren't limitted to that. Indeed, they also do dubbing and take care of sound design which especially in Limbus Company is Exceptional with each attack having its own distinct effect, thus making it possible to not only identity the ID that is attacking/clashing but also in some cases, you can even identify the specific attack.<br> Mili on the other hand, is a Japanese based band that only takes care of the titular canto's song, as stated previously. This song is only heard during the final boss fight and when the credits roll with its lyrics and tune being perfectly remminiscent of the story that just unfolded before your eyes. Such songs include "Through patches of violet" where we have 2 superimposing voices that represent Heathcliff and Catherine with them being ever so slightly out of sync with each other, representing their inability to communicate with each other, despite how close they were.</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/horns.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure> <!--change this at some point into a hover show and maybe change it into something less cluttered (rip my shin/mang/manifesting one's ego segway)-->
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Accessibility</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The game is voiced exclusively in Korean with an english and chinese translation being available which is somewhat limiting, but do keep in mind that this is only a small independant game studio so it's already quite good, especially seeing the quality of the voices acting as you don't need to speak korean to be able to appreciate the effort and emotions put into it. As mentioned in the gameplay section, the game itself is quite accessible at a basic level, however bothced the in-game tutorial may be. To compensate for the lackluster tutorial, you can find a flury of videos online that do a much better job at explaining the in-game mechanics which definetly makes certain aspects of the game a lot easier to approach once you have that extra knowledge in mind. As for the lack of english voice over, if it truly is a dealbreaker for you as you're going to have to read, 2 words: grow up. You're not 5 years old and are more than capable of reading some text on a sceen.</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Big clash.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In unfocused encounters, you simply drag a chain across all skins you want to use at the bottom of the screen and they will automatically target ennemy skills. These tend to be the easier battles but upon reaching a certain level of difficulty, they actually become rather cumbersome as the game choose where you attacks go automatically meaning you need to manipulate it to succeed. This requires a fair bit of game knowledge and is why you only really need to do it while deep in the dungeon</p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Dawn of green.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In focused encounters however, it is you the player who chooses specifically where each skill goes. This is where the teambuilding and strategising aspect of the game shines as you need to carefully anticipate not only the ennemy's attacks a few turns in advance but also your own in order to be as efficient as possible. As in you need to manage your status applications, damage dealt, damage recieved and ennemy phase changes in most cases. </p>
                                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Focused butler.png" alt="V1 being cool" /></figure>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Another important aspect of combat is the usage of EGO that are special attacks that come from abnomalities such as Fourth March Flamme originating from Scorched Girl or Tears of the Tarnished blood that is extracted from Yinglong. On a basic level, these serve only as high rolling attacks to win clashes but in the hands of any knowledgable player, they become stepping stones for intricate strategies through their unique status applications and passives. Each EGO posseses it's own "risk level" which reflects it's power, to some degree at least. This risk level can and can't be based on the original obnomality as it depends on the wielder's predisposition.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As mentioned on the main page, this game is entierelly based on adaptations of famous novels from all around the world but also some modern elements of pop culture such as Half Life though they are more scarce. The story itself is divided into cantos just like in Dante Allegri's Divine Comedy. In each canto, we explore the fathoms of the respective sinner, exploring their past and helping them come to terms with it. In total we can count 13 classic novels: The Metamorphosis, Crime and Punishement, Demian a story of boyhood, The Wings, Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights, Don Quixote, Dream of the red chamber, Hell Screen, The Stranger, The Odyssey, Faust and Inferno with them corresponding to the characters of Gregor, Rodion, Sinclair, Yi Sang, Ishmael, Heathcliff, Don Quixote, Hong Lu, Ryōshū, Mersault, Outis, Faust and Dante.<br> The goal of the company isn't itself to solve our sinner's trauma but rather to collect the Golden Boughs, branches of the Tree of Life that hold limitless possibilities, helping our characters is purely a byproduct of that quest. <br> There are obviously a lot more references but talking about them all would take hours of litterary analysis and cross referencing obscure lines of dialogue which far exceeds the scope of this website but that won't stop me from mentioning a few such as indiscriminate religious references like the Tree of Life from Budhism(?) and the 4 horesmen of the apocalypse but also some folklore, notably germanic in the form of The Wild Hunt and Der Freischütz.<br> What I can say however is that the story and characters are extremelly well written and handled, you really feel their character growth throughout the story and having read most of the source material, I get to really appreciate the tiny details that are scattered throughout, may they be explicit or implicit.<br> Overall, the simple fact that every canto centers around a different character while dealing with themes related to them results in the themes discussed being so varied that there is something for everyone so all can enjoy. This keeps the game fresh any time the story progresses and keeps every new canto feeling fresh and emotionally impactful.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Game performance</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe.</p>
