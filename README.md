This will be the repository containing all the files related to my website

It is for a computer science project and will discuss the story of a few car brands. The website is in french as that is my mother tongue.
I will however doing an english version sometime in the future although I doubt many people are going to see this anyway.
I don't have mush more to say so enjoy the website, it's still pretty barebones at the moment but I will improve it over time. I have also added some funky effects to it all (namely the rainbow text) that while they look cool were probably not worth my time.

Anyway, have a good day and enjoy my website!

PS: There is one CSS file per HTML file because I suck at coding and found it easier to do things this way so apologies for the lack of sense in it.
